# DBSCAN
## (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

### The python version of DBSCAN was taken from [Chris McCormick's tutorial](https://medium.com/nearist-ai/dbscan-clustering-tutorial-dd6a9b637a4b) and modified to use a distance function that works with 3D points.  It uses matplotlib to visualize the resulting data.  Clusters are denoted by different colors, and noise is denoted with small black points.

# With noisy data points

### The C++ version is also modeled after Chris McCormick's implementation but aims to optimize performance.  This is still a work in progress.
