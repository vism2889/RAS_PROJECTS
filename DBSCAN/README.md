# DBSCAN

### This version of DBSCAN was taken from [this](https://medium.com/nearist-ai/dbscan-clustering-tutorial-dd6a9b637a4b) tutorial and modified to use a distance function that works with 3D points.  It uses matplotlib to visualize the data and clusterlabels.  Clusters are denoted by different colors, and noise is denoted with a small black point.
