# Vroom vroom skrrt!  A simulator created in unity to gather artificial training data for an autonomous vehicle.  The simulator attempts to replicate the camera sensor array from the specifications of a physical vehicle.

### Progress
- Basic camera configuration done.
### TODO:
- Create waypoint spline.
- Script to output camera feed to mp4 files.
- Create or buy better race-car asset that resembles our use case better.
